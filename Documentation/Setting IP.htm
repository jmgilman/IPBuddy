		<h1>Setting IP</h1><br />
		<p>IPBuddy allows you to either set a static IP address on a network adapter or force a network adapter back to DHCP. IPBuddy utilizes this functionality to help connect to local network controllers on potentially complex networks. Therefore, the settings for the static IP address are located in the NAE information.
		</p>
		<h2>Set a static IP address</h2>
		<p>To set a static IP address:
			<ul>
				<li>Select an NAE from the main list</li>
				<li>In the NAE settings table, verify the values for 'Static IP', 'Static Subnet', and 'Static Gateway' are correct.</li>
				<li>From the 'Network Adapters' area select the network adapter in the drop-down menu you would like to apply this IP to.</li>
				<li>Click the 'Set Static' button.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>To set DHCP</h2>

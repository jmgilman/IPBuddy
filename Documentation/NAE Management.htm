		<h1>NAE Management</h1><br />
		<h2>Adding an NAE</h2>
		<p>There are two methods to add a new NAE to a site:
			<ul>
				<li>Select the site you wish to add an NAE to in the main list and then from the 'File' menu, select 'New' and then 'NAE'.</li>
				<li>Right-click on the site you wish to add an NAE to and select 'New NAE' from the resulting menu.</li>
			<ul>
			Both of these methods will create a new NAE on the selected site with a default name of 'New NAE' and will initially prompt you to change the name. To change the name at a later date, simply double-click the name in the list and change it accordingly.
		</p>
		<h2>Removing an NAE</h2>
		<p>To remove an NAE, right-click it in the main list and select 'Delete' from the resulting menu.</p>
		<h2>Exporting an NAE</h2>
		<p>To export an NAE:
			<ul>
				<li>Right-click the NAE you wish to export in the main list.</li>
				<li>Select 'Export' from the resulting menu.</li>
				<li>Enter in a file name (or accept the default name) to export to and select 'Save.'</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Importing an NAE<h2>
		<p>To import an NAE:
			<ul>
				<li>Right-click on the site you wish to add the NAE to.</li>
				<li>Select 'Import NAE' from the resulting menu</li>
				<li>Select the appropriate NAE XML file and select 'Open.'</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Launching an NAE</h2>
		<p>There are two ways to launch an NAE:
			<ul>
				<li>Right-click the NAE and select 'Launch' from the resulting menu.</li>
				<li>Select the NAE in the main list and click the 'Launch' button.</li>
			</ul>
			Please note this process is dependant on the version of the NAE. If no MSEA version is defined or the main version is less than 6, the default launch method via Internet Explorer will be used. If the MSEA version is defined and the main version is greater than 6, the new 'Launcher' method will be utilized to directly launch the Metasys user interface for the NAE.

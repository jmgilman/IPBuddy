		<h1>NAE Listener</h1><br />
		<p>The NAE Listener is a tool that broadcasts and listens for network controllers reporting on attached networked devices. It's main form can be reached by selecting the 'Tools' menu and then 'NAE Listener' from the resulting menu. When IPBuddy starts, the program automatically starts listening for NAE's reporting on the attached network adapters. When a network controller reports on the network, it's information will be captured and saved in the device list found on the NAE Listener form.
		</p>
		<h2>Broadcasting to NAE's</h2>
		<p>By clicking the 'Broadcast' button a packet will be sent out on the local network and any network controllers listening will be requested to respond. Please note it may take time for this packet to travel the network and so there may be a delay in network controllers showing up in the device list.
		</p>
		<h2>Importing an NAE</h2>
		<p>The NAE Listener tool will allow you to import an NAE from the device list into a site in the main IPBuddy program. To do this:
			<ul>
				<li>Select the NAE in the device list.</li>
				<li>Click the 'Import' button</li>
				<li>From the resulting dialog menu select the site you wish to import the NAE to and then click the 'Import' button.</li>
			</ul>

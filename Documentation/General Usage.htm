		<h2>Saving Your Configured Settings</h2>
		<p>Please note that by default the program does not save your configured settings. IPBuddy stores all program settings in an XML format.</p>
		<p>To save your settings, click the 'File' button at the top of the program and select the 'Save' option from the resulting drop-down list. This will save your current settings to the file 'default.xml' in the current program directory. When the program starts it automatically searches for this 'default.xml' file and loads it upon starting up.</p>
		<p>To save your settings to a different file other than 'default.xml', click the 'File' button at the top of the program and select 'Save As' from the resulting drop-down list. The program will open a file dialog and prompt you for the location to save the configuration file to. Select a location and name for the file and then click 'Save'.</p>
		<p>To load previous settings you saved in a configuration file, click the 'File' button at the top of the program and select 'Open' from the resulting drop-down list. The program will open a file dialog and prompt for the location of the previously saved configuration file. Select the file and then select 'Open' to load the configuration file into the program. Please note this overrides any existing configuration settings in the program.</p>

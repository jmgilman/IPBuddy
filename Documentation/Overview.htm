		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p>IPBuddy at its core is a very simple program to operate. IPBuddy stores all information in a tree-like list located at the side of the main program panel. This list consists of sites and network controllers (NAEs). A site is a physical location in the world, like a customer's building. Since each site can contain multiple controllers, each site in IPBuddy can have multiple NAEs. The goal of this type of structure is to allow a technician to keep all of their commonly used NAEs organized to the various sites they visit on a normal basis.</p>
